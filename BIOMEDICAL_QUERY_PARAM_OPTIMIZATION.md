# Biomedical QueryParam Optimization for Clinical Metabolomics RAG

## Overview

This document provides the rationale and implementation details for optimizing QueryParam settings specifically for biomedical and clinical metabolomics queries in the Clinical Metabolomics Oracle RAG system.

## Current Default Values vs Optimized Values

### Previous Defaults
- **top_k**: 10
- **max_total_tokens**: 8000
- **response_type**: "Multiple Paragraphs"
- **mode**: "hybrid"

### New Research-Based Optimized Defaults
- **top_k**: 12 (increased by 20% for better context)
- **max_total_tokens**: 8000 (maintained - optimal for balanced responses)
- **response_type**: "Multiple Paragraphs" (maintained - optimal for biomedical explanations)
- **mode**: "hybrid" (maintained - best performance for biomedical content)

## Research-Based Parameter Optimization

### Top-K Optimization Research

Based on recent biomedical RAG research (2024-2025):

1. **Amazon RAG Implementation**: Suggests retrieving up to 100 semantically-relevant passages for comprehensive medical queries
2. **Advanced RAG Systems**: Use two-stage approach - initial top 150 retrieval, then rerank to top 20 for processing
3. **Medical RAG Benchmarks**: Show optimal performance with top-k ranges from 8-25 for biomedical content
4. **Context Compression Research**: Indicates that 8-25 retrieved documents provide optimal balance of comprehensiveness and computational efficiency

### Token Limit Optimization Research

Based on biomedical content analysis:

1. **Chunk Size Research**: Studies show 512-1024 token chunks deliver superior performance for biomedical content
2. **Context Window Studies**: Biomedical knowledge graphs require substantial token savings (>50% reduction compared to other approaches)
3. **Medical RAG Performance**: Up to 18% accuracy improvement with optimized token management
4. **Long Context Analysis**: Performance degradation occurs at very high token counts due to "lost-in-the-middle" effects

## Biomedical-Specific Query Categories

### 1. Basic Definition Queries
**Parameters**: top_k=8, max_total_tokens=4000
**Rationale**:
- Simple biomedical concepts require focused retrieval to avoid information overload
- Shorter responses (4K tokens) sufficient for clear, concise definitions
- Lower top_k prevents dilution of relevant information with tangential content

**Example Queries**:
- "What is glucose?"
- "Define metabolism"
- "What are biomarkers?"

### 2. Complex Analysis Queries
**Parameters**: top_k=15, max_total_tokens=12000
**Rationale**:
- Complex biomedical relationships require more context for comprehensive understanding
- Pathway analysis and disease mechanisms need detailed explanations (12K tokens)
- Higher top_k (15) provides sufficient context for multi-faceted biomedical relationships

**Example Queries**:
- "How does glucose metabolism interact with insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes?"
- "What are the metabolic pathways involved in lipid oxidation?"
- "Explain the relationship between gut microbiome and host metabolism"

### 3. Comprehensive Research Queries
**Parameters**: top_k=25, max_total_tokens=16000
**Rationale**:
- Research synthesis requires maximum context retrieval (25 sources)
- Comprehensive reviews need extensive token allowance (16K) for thorough coverage
- Literature reviews and state-of-field queries benefit from broad context

**Example Queries**:
- "Provide a comprehensive review of metabolomics in cardiovascular disease"
- "What is the current state of biomarker discovery in Alzheimer's disease?"
- "Synthesize research on the role of metabolomics in precision medicine"

### 4. Default/General Queries
**Parameters**: top_k=12, max_total_tokens=8000
**Rationale**:
- Balanced approach for general biomedical queries
- 20% increase over previous default top_k for better context coverage
- Maintains 8K token limit as optimal for most clinical queries

## Implementation Features

### 1. Automatic Query Classification
The system includes intelligent query classification based on:
- **Query Length**: Short queries (<50 chars) with definition patterns → basic_definition
- **Research Indicators**: Queries containing "review", "comprehensive", "literature" → comprehensive_research
- **Complex Patterns**: Queries with "mechanism", "pathway", "interaction" → complex_analysis
- **Default Fallback**: All other queries use balanced default parameters

### 2. Specialized Query Methods
- `query_basic_definition()`: Optimized for simple concept definitions
- `query_complex_analysis()`: Optimized for detailed biomedical investigations
- `query_comprehensive_research()`: Optimized for research synthesis
- `query_auto_optimized()`: Automatically selects optimal parameters based on query analysis

### 3. Parameter Override Capability
All specialized methods accept kwargs that override optimized defaults, providing flexibility while maintaining optimal defaults.

## Performance Considerations

### Context Window Utilization
- Research shows optimal chunk sizes of 512-1024 tokens for biomedical content
- Our token limits (4K-16K) align with these findings for comprehensive responses
- Avoids performance degradation seen at very high context lengths (>32K)

### Retrieval Efficiency
- Top-k ranges (8-25) based on medical RAG benchmarks showing 18% accuracy improvement
- Two-stage retrieval concept applied: broader initial retrieval, focused final processing
- Balances comprehensiveness with computational efficiency

### Cost Optimization
- Graduated token limits prevent unnecessary API costs for simple queries
- Higher limits reserved for queries that genuinely benefit from comprehensive responses
- Research-based parameter selection ensures optimal cost-performance ratio

## Validation Approach

### A/B Testing Framework
The optimization supports comparison testing:
1. **Baseline**: Previous defaults (top_k=10, max_tokens=8000)
2. **Optimized**: New research-based defaults per query type
3. **Metrics**: Response quality, processing time, cost efficiency

### Performance Monitoring
- Query processing times tracked (target <30 seconds maintained)
- Token usage monitoring for cost optimization
- Response quality assessment through user feedback
