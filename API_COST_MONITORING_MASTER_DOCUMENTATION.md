### Architecture Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a single, well-defined responsibility
2. **Dependency Injection**: Components are loosely coupled through interfaces
3. **Thread Safety**: All components support concurrent access
4. **Error Isolation**: Failures in one component don't cascade to others
5. **Configuration-Driven**: Behavior controlled through comprehensive configuration
6. **Audit-First**: All actions logged for compliance and debugging

## Quick Start

### 1. Installation and Setup

```python
from lightrag_integration import BudgetManagementFactory, LightRAGConfig

# Create configuration from environment variables
config = LightRAGConfig.get_config()

# Initialize budget management system
budget_system = BudgetManagementFactory.create_complete_system(
    lightrag_config=config,
    daily_budget_limit=50.0,
    monthly_budget_limit=1000.0
)

# Start monitoring
budget_system.start()
```

### 2. Basic Usage

```python
# Track an API call
with budget_system.track_operation("llm_call", model="gpt-4o-mini") as tracker:
    # Make API call
    result = your_api_call()
    
    # Update metrics
    tracker.set_tokens(prompt=100, completion=50)
    tracker.set_cost(0.01)

# Check budget status
status = budget_system.get_budget_status()
print(f"Daily usage: {status['daily']['percentage_used']:.1f}%")

# Get dashboard metrics
metrics = budget_system.dashboard.get_dashboard_overview()
```

### 3. Environment Configuration

```bash
# Required
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"

# Budget limits
export LIGHTRAG_DAILY_BUDGET_LIMIT="50.0"
export LIGHTRAG_MONTHLY_BUDGET_LIMIT="1000.0"
