## Integration Testing Framework Overview

The integration testing framework consists of five comprehensive test suites designed to validate every aspect of the enhanced system:

```
Integration Testing Framework
├── Backward Compatibility Tests    # Ensures no breaking changes
├── Enhanced Functionality Tests     # Validates LLM improvements  
├── Migration Testing Framework      # Safe deployment validation

## Backward Compatibility Validation

### Overview

The backward compatibility test suite ensures that all existing functionality continues to work exactly as before, with no breaking changes to APIs, behavior, or performance.

### Key Validation Areas

#### 1. API Compatibility
```python
# Validates that all existing APIs work unchanged
- BiomedicalQueryRouter.route_query() signature unchanged
- RoutingPrediction structure preserved
- ConfidenceMetrics format maintained  
- Configuration options backward compatible
```

#### 2. Behavioral Consistency
```python
# Ensures routing decisions remain consistent
- Same queries produce same routing decisions (>90% consistency)
- Confidence scores within acceptable variance (±10%)
- Performance characteristics maintained
- Error handling behavior preserved
```

#### 3. Configuration Migration
```python
# Validates smooth configuration transition
- Existing configurations continue to work
- New features are opt-in only
- Legacy settings are preserved
- Feature flags control enhanced functionality
```

### Running Compatibility Tests

```bash
# Full backward compatibility validation
pytest lightrag_integration/tests/test_llm_integration_comprehensive.py::TestLLMIntegrationComprehensive::test_backward_compatibility_comprehensive -v

# Expected Output:
# ✓ API compatibility tests passed (15/15)
# ✓ Behavioral consistency validated (>90% consistent)  
# ✓ Performance regression check passed (<5% degradation)
# ✓ Configuration compatibility verified
```

## Migration Testing Framework

### Overview

The migration testing framework validates safe, zero-downtime deployment of the enhanced system with comprehensive rollback capabilities.

### Migration Components

#### 1. Pre-deployment Validation
```python
# System Readiness Checks
Pre-deployment Checklist:
- ✓ Configuration backup completed
- ✓ Database schema migration prepared
- ✓ Service health verification
- ✓ Baseline functionality testing
- ✓ Resource availability confirmed
```

#### 2. Zero-downtime Deployment
```python
# Gradual Traffic Migration
Deployment Phases:
1. Start enhanced service alongside existing
2. Health check new service (2 minutes)
3. Route 10% traffic to enhanced service
4. Monitor performance and errors (5 minutes)
5. Gradually increase traffic: 25% → 50% → 75% → 100%
6. Complete migration and stop old service
```

#### 3. Rollback Procedures
```python
# Safe Rollback Capabilities
Rollback Triggers:
- Error rate > 5% for 2 minutes
- Response time > 150% baseline for 5 minutes
- Service health check failures
- Manual rollback request

Rollback Process:
1. Stop traffic to enhanced service (<30 seconds)
2. Restore traffic to baseline service
3. Rollback database changes
4. Restore previous configuration
5. Validate system functionality
```

## Rollback Procedures

### When to Rollback

#### Automatic Rollback Triggers
- Error rate > 5% for 2+ consecutive minutes
- Average response time > 200% baseline for 5+ minutes  
- Service availability < 95% for 1+ minute
- Memory usage > 95% for 2+ minutes
- Critical functionality failures

#### Manual Rollback Triggers
- Stakeholder request
- Critical security issue discovered
- Data integrity concerns
- Business impact assessment

### Rollback Process

#### Emergency Rollback (< 5 minutes)
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# emergency_rollback.sh - Fast rollback for critical issues

echo "$(date): EMERGENCY ROLLBACK INITIATED" >> /var/log/deployment.log

# 1. Immediate traffic redirect to baseline service
curl -X PUT http://load-balancer/config \
  -d '{"upstream": [{"server": "localhost:8080", "weight": 100}]}' \
  || echo "CRITICAL: Load balancer update failed"

# 2. Restart baseline service if stopped
docker start lightrag-baseline || docker run -d --name lightrag-baseline \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v /backup:/config \
  -v /data:/data \
  lightrag:baseline-v0.9.0

# 3. Stop enhanced service
docker stop lightrag-enhanced

# 4. Restore baseline configuration
cp /backup/config_*.json /etc/lightrag/config.json

# 5. Validate baseline service
timeout 60 bash -c 'until curl -f http://localhost:8080/health; do sleep 2; done' \
  || { echo "CRITICAL: Baseline service health check failed"; exit 1; }

echo "$(date): Emergency rollback completed successfully" >> /var/log/deployment.log
echo "✓ Emergency rollback completed - system restored to baseline"
```

#### Planned Rollback (< 15 minutes)
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# planned_rollback.sh - Gradual rollback with validation

echo "$(date): PLANNED ROLLBACK INITIATED" >> /var/log/deployment.log

# 1. Gradual traffic reduction from enhanced service
for weight in 75 50 25 10 0; do
  echo "Reducing enhanced service traffic to ${weight}%"
  curl -X PUT http://load-balancer/config \
    -d "{\"upstream\": [{\"server\": \"localhost:8080\", \"weight\": $((100-weight))}, {\"server\": \"localhost:8081\", \"weight\": ${weight}}]}"
  
  sleep 120  # Wait 2 minutes between steps
  
  # Monitor metrics during rollback
  curl -s http://localhost:8080/metrics | grep error_rate
done

# 2. Stop enhanced service
docker stop lightrag-enhanced

# 3. Database rollback if needed
if [ -f "/backup/lightrag_backup.db" ]; then
  echo "Restoring database backup..."
  cp /backup/lightrag_backup.db /data/lightrag.db
fi

# 4. Configuration rollback
cp /backup/config_backup.json /etc/lightrag/config.json

# 5. Comprehensive validation
python -m pytest lightrag_integration/tests/test_llm_integration_comprehensive.py::TestLLMIntegrationComprehensive::test_backward_compatibility_comprehensive -v

echo "$(date): Planned rollback completed successfully" >> /var/log/deployment.log
```

### Post-rollback Validation

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# post_rollback_validation.py

import requests
import json
import sys

def validate_rollback():
    """Validate system functionality after rollback."""
    
    print("Running post-rollback validation...")
    
    # 1. Health check
    try:
        response = requests.get('http://localhost:8080/health', timeout=5)
        assert response.status_code == 200
        print("✓ Health check passed")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"✗ Health check failed: {e}")
        return False
    
    # 2. Functionality test
    try:
        response = requests.post(
            'http://localhost:8080/query',
            json={'query': 'What are metabolomics biomarkers for diabetes?'},
            timeout=10
        )
        assert response.status_code == 200
        data = response.json()
        assert data.get('confidence', 0) > 0.3
        print(f"✓ Functionality test passed (confidence: {data.get('confidence')})")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"✗ Functionality test failed: {e}")
        return False
    
    # 3. Performance test
    import time
    response_times = []
    
    for i in range(10):
        try:
            start = time.time()
            response = requests.post(
                'http://localhost:8080/query',
                json={'query': f'Test query {i}'},
                timeout=5
            )
            response_time = (time.time() - start) * 1000
            
            if response.status_code == 200:
                response_times.append(response_time)
        except:
            pass
    
    if response_times:
        avg_response_time = sum(response_times) / len(response_times)
        print(f"✓ Performance test passed (avg: {avg_response_time:.2f}ms)")
        
        if avg_response_time > 1000:
            print("⚠️  WARNING: Response time higher than expected")
    else:
        print("✗ Performance test failed - no successful responses")
        return False
    
    print("✅ All post-rollback validations passed")
    return True

if __name__ == "__main__":
    success = validate_rollback()
    sys.exit(0 if success else 1)
```
