================================================================================

1. PATTERN-SPECIFIC ACCURACY ANALYSIS:
==================================================
LIGHTRAG_MISCLASSIFIED: 30.0% ✗ CRITICAL
HYBRID_UNDERDETECTED: 16.7% ✗ CRITICAL
TEMPORAL_INDICATORS: 100.0% ✓ GOOD
CONFIDENCE_CALIBRATION: 0.0% ✗ CRITICAL

2. PRIORITY IMPROVEMENTS:
==================================================
HIGH PRIORITY:
  • Enhance combination keyword pattern matching (frequency: 10)
  • Increase weight for biological process indicators (frequency: 7)
  • Improve confidence scoring for molecular mechanism queries (frequency: 7)
  • Strengthen temporal + knowledge hybrid detection (frequency: 6)

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
  • Adjust confidence thresholds for different query categories (frequency: 2)

3. CONFIDENCE CALIBRATION:
==================================================
Correct predictions avg confidence: 0.599
Incorrect predictions avg confidence: 0.000
Confidence discrimination: 0.000
⚠ Poor confidence calibration - correct predictions should have higher confidence

4. IMPLEMENTATION RECOMMENDATIONS:
==================================================
A. Immediate Actions (Week 1):
   - Enhance keyword detection for pathway/mechanism queries
   - Improve temporal indicator pattern matching
   - Calibrate confidence thresholds per category

B. Short-term Improvements (2-4 weeks):
   - Implement hybrid query detection improvements
   - Add biomedical entity count weighting
   - Create confidence score validation framework

C. Long-term Enhancements (1-2 months):
   - Machine learning model fine-tuning
   - Advanced pattern recognition for complex queries
   - Continuous accuracy monitoring system

5. SUCCESS METRICS:
==================================================
Target Goals:
  • Overall routing accuracy: >90%
  • LIGHTRAG pathway queries: >85%
  • HYBRID detection: >75%
  • Temporal queries: >90%
  • Confidence discrimination: >0.25
