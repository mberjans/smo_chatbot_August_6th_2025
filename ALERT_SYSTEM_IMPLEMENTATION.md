# Alert Management System Implementation

## Overview

The Clinical Metabolomics Oracle Alert Management System has been successfully implemented and integrated with the existing health monitoring infrastructure. The system provides comprehensive alerting capabilities for health threshold monitoring, alert delivery, and alert lifecycle management.

## Key Components Implemented

**Location**: `lightrag_integration/intelligent_query_router.py` (lines 550-1070)

**Features**:
- **Alert Generation**: Automatically generates alerts when health metrics breach configured thresholds
- **Alert Suppression**: Prevents alert spam through configurable suppression rules
- **Alert Acknowledgment**: Allows operators to acknowledge alerts to indicate awareness
- **Auto-Recovery**: Automatically resolves alerts when metrics improve
- **Alert History**: Maintains comprehensive history for analytics and trends
- **Statistics**: Provides detailed alert analytics and reporting

### 2. Alert Callback System
**Location**: `lightrag_integration/intelligent_query_router.py` (lines 405-549)

**Implementations**:
- **ConsoleAlertCallback**: Logs alerts to console/logger with severity-based formatting
- **JSONFileAlertCallback**: Persists alerts to JSON files with rotation management
- **WebhookAlertCallback**: Sends alerts to external systems via HTTP webhooks

### 3. Enhanced SystemHealthMonitor Integration
**Location**: `lightrag_integration/intelligent_query_router.py` (lines 1573-1850)

**Enhancements**:
- Integrated AlertManager for threshold monitoring
- Added alert generation to health check process
- Implemented alert management methods (acknowledge, resolve, get history)
- Enhanced resource usage monitoring for alert triggers

### 4. IntelligentQueryRouter Alert Methods
**Location**: `lightrag_integration/intelligent_query_router.py` (lines 2314-2441)

**Public API Methods**:
- `get_active_alerts()` - Retrieve active alerts with filtering
- `acknowledge_alert()` - Acknowledge specific alerts
- `resolve_alert()` - Manually resolve alerts
- `get_alert_history()` - Retrieve alert history with time filtering
- `get_alert_statistics()` - Get comprehensive alert analytics
- `configure_alert_thresholds()` - Update alert thresholds dynamically
- `register_alert_callback()` - Register custom alert callbacks
- `get_system_health_with_alerts()` - Comprehensive health status with alert information

## Alert Threshold Configuration

### Default Thresholds
The system includes comprehensive default thresholds for:

- **Response Time**: Warning: 1000ms, Critical: 2000ms, Emergency: 5000ms
- **Error Rate**: Warning: 5%, Critical: 15%, Emergency: 30%
- **Availability**: Warning: 95%, Critical: 90%, Emergency: 80%
- **Health Score**: Warning: 80, Critical: 60, Emergency: 40
- **Consecutive Failures**: Warning: 3, Critical: 5, Emergency: 10
- **Resource Usage**: CPU/Memory/Disk with Warning: 70%, Critical: 85%, Emergency: 95%
- **API Quota**: Warning: 80%, Critical: 90%, Emergency: 95%

### Configurable Thresholds
All thresholds are fully configurable through the `AlertThresholds` class and can be updated dynamically during runtime.

## Alert Suppression System

### Suppression Rules
The system includes intelligent suppression rules to prevent alert spam:

- **Response Time Alerts**: Max 3 occurrences in 5 minutes
- **Error Rate Alerts**: Max 2 occurrences in 3 minutes  
- **Availability Alerts**: Max 1 occurrence in 10 minutes
- **Health Score Alerts**: Max 2 occurrences in 5 minutes

### Pattern Matching
Supports wildcard pattern matching for flexible suppression rule application.

## Integration Points

### 1. Health Check Process
The alert system is seamlessly integrated into the existing health check loop:
- Alerts are generated after each health check cycle
- Resource usage monitoring triggers resource-based alerts
- Performance metrics are updated with alert generation statistics

### 2. Load Balancing
The alert system works with the existing load balancing system:
- Health-aware routing considers alert states
- Circuit breaker patterns respect alert thresholds

### 3. Analytics Integration
Alert data is integrated with the existing analytics framework:
- Alert statistics are included in system health summaries
- Alert trends contribute to performance analytics

## Files Created/Modified

### Modified Files
- `lightrag_integration/intelligent_query_router.py` - Core implementation (2400+ lines added)

### New Files
- `test_alert_system.py` - Comprehensive test suite for alert system functionality
- `alert_system_demo.py` - Production-ready demonstration and usage examples
- `logs/alerts/health_alerts.json` - Default alert persistence file
- `logs/test_alerts.json` - Test alert output file

## Testing and Validation

### Test Coverage
The implementation includes comprehensive tests covering:

1. **Alert Generation**: Validates alert creation for various threshold breaches
2. **Alert Suppression**: Tests suppression logic and pattern matching
3. **Alert Acknowledgment**: Tests alert acknowledgment and resolution workflows  
4. **Callback System**: Validates all callback types and error handling
5. **Statistics**: Tests alert analytics and history management
6. **Threshold Configuration**: Tests dynamic threshold updates
7. **Integration**: Tests comprehensive health status with alerts

### Test Results
All tests pass successfully:
- ✅ Alert Generation PASSED
- ✅ Alert Suppression PASSED  
- ✅ Alert Acknowledgment PASSED
- ✅ Callback System PASSED
- ✅ Alert Statistics PASSED
- ✅ Threshold Configuration PASSED
- ✅ Comprehensive Health Status PASSED

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```python
from lightrag_integration.intelligent_query_router import IntelligentQueryRouter

# Initialize with default settings
router = IntelligentQueryRouter()

# Get active alerts
alerts = router.get_active_alerts()

# Acknowledge an alert
router.acknowledge_alert("response_time_lightrag_warning", "ops_team")

# Get comprehensive health status with alerts
health = router.get_system_health_with_alerts()
```

### Production Configuration
```python
from lightrag_integration.intelligent_query_router import (
    IntelligentQueryRouter, HealthCheckConfig, AlertThresholds
)

# Configure production thresholds
thresholds = AlertThresholds(
    response_time_warning=500.0,
    error_rate_warning=0.01,
    availability_warning=99.0
)

health_config = HealthCheckConfig(alert_thresholds=thresholds)
router = IntelligentQueryRouter(health_check_config=health_config)

# Register production callbacks
router.register_alert_callback("webhook", 
                               webhook_url="https://hooks.slack.com/your-webhook")
router.register_alert_callback("json_file", 
                               file_path="/var/log/cmo/alerts.json")
```

## Production Recommendations

1. **Threshold Tuning**: Adjust thresholds based on system baseline performance
2. **Webhook Integration**: Configure webhooks for Slack, Teams, or PagerDuty
3. **Persistent Storage**: Use JSON file callbacks with log rotation
4. **Monitoring**: Implement regular alert trend analysis
5. **Escalation**: Set up escalation policies for unacknowledged critical alerts
6. **Environment-Specific**: Use different thresholds for dev/staging/production
7. **Auto-Recovery**: Enable auto-recovery monitoring for self-healing systems
8. **Suppression Rules**: Customize suppression rules to reduce noise
9. **Alert History**: Implement alert history analysis for performance insights
10. **Health-Aware Routing**: Use alert states in load balancing decisions
