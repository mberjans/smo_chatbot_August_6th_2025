## Conclusion

While the current 5% overall coverage is significantly below the 90% target, the analysis reveals that:

1. **Core infrastructure is well-tested** - Configuration modules show excellent coverage
2. **Test framework is functional** - Successfully executed 227 tests
3. **Critical modules need focused effort** - Main application logic requires extensive testing
4. **Path to success is clear** - Specific recommendations provided for systematic improvement

The project has a solid foundation for comprehensive testing, but requires dedicated effort to achieve the coverage targets. The modular architecture and existing test infrastructure provide a strong starting point for systematic coverage improvement.

**Recommendation: Proceed with Phase 1 critical module testing to achieve meaningful coverage improvements within the next sprint.**
