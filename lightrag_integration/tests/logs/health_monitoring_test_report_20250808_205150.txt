⚠️  Service availability management needs enhancement

RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------------------------------------------
1. CRITICAL: Test success rate is below 80%. Review failed test categories and fix underlying issues.
2. CRITICAL: Health monitoring effectiveness is low. Review and enhance health monitoring integration.
3. CIRCUIT BREAKER: Enhance circuit breaker implementation to improve failure handling.
4. FAILURE DETECTION: Improve failure detection mechanisms for better system resilience.
5. LOAD BALANCING: Enhance load balancing algorithms to better distribute requests based on health.
6. MONITORING: Continue to monitor system health metrics in production to validate test assumptions.
7. DOCUMENTATION: Update system documentation to reflect health monitoring integration patterns.
