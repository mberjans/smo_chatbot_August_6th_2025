## Integration with Production System

### 1. **Replace Mock Components**
The test suite is designed to work with the actual production components:
- Replace `MockBiomedicalQueryRouter` with actual `BiomedicalQueryRouter`
- Use real `ConfidenceMetrics`, `FallbackStrategy`, and `ResearchCategorizer`
- Update test expectations based on actual component behavior

### 2. **Confidence Threshold Tuning**
The test framework supports easy adjustment of confidence thresholds:
- Modify `routing_thresholds` in the router configuration
- Update test assertions based on production performance
- Calibrate accuracy expectations with real-world data

### 3. **Performance Benchmarking**
Use the provided performance testing framework:
- `run_performance_benchmark()` function for load testing
- Concurrent execution validation
- Memory usage monitoring
- Response time distribution analysis

## Recommendations for Production Deployment

### 1. **Gradual Rollout**
- Start with high-confidence queries (≥0.8) for direct routing
- Monitor medium-confidence queries (0.6-0.8) with fallback options
- Implement uncertainty detection for low-confidence queries (<0.6)

### 2. **Continuous Monitoring**
- Track routing accuracy by category
- Monitor confidence calibration over time
- Validate performance metrics in production
- Implement feedback loops for routing improvements

### 3. **A/B Testing Framework**
The test suite provides the foundation for:
- Routing decision comparison testing
- Confidence threshold optimization
- Performance impact measurement
- User experience validation
