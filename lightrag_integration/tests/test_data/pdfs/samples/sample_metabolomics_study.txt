ABSTRACT
This study investigates metabolomic profiles in Type 2 diabetes patients compared to healthy controls. Using LC-MS/MS analysis, we identified 150 metabolites with significant differential expression. Key findings include elevated glucose-6-phosphate and reduced citric acid cycle intermediates in diabetic patients.

INTRODUCTION
Metabolomics provides insights into disease pathophysiology by measuring small molecule metabolites in biological samples. This approach has shown promise in diabetes research for identifying biomarkers and understanding metabolic dysregulation.

METHODS
Sample Collection: Plasma samples from 100 T2D patients and 50 controls
Analytical Platform: LC-MS/MS using Thermo Q Exactive
Data Processing: XCMS and MetaboAnalyst workflows
Statistical Analysis: t-tests, PCA, pathway enrichment

RESULTS
- 47 metabolites significantly upregulated in T2D (p < 0.05)
- 38 metabolites significantly downregulated 
- Glucose metabolism pathway most affected
- Amino acid metabolism also disrupted

CONCLUSIONS
Metabolomic profiling reveals distinct metabolic signatures in T2D patients, supporting its use for biomarker discovery and therapeutic monitoring.
