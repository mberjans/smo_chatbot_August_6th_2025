Title: Phase II Clinical Trial of Metabolomic-Guided Therapy in Cardiovascular Disease
Trial ID: CMO-CVD-2024-001
Principal Investigator: Dr. Clinical Researcher

STUDY OVERVIEW
This randomized controlled trial evaluates whether metabolomic profiling can improve treatment outcomes in cardiovascular disease patients. The study compares standard care versus metabolomic-guided therapy selection.

STUDY DESIGN
- Design: Double-blind, randomized controlled trial
- Population: Adult patients with stable coronary artery disease
- Sample Size: 200 participants (100 per arm)
- Duration: 12-month follow-up
- Primary Endpoint: Major adverse cardiovascular events

INCLUSION CRITERIA
- Age 18-75 years
- Diagnosed stable CAD
- On standard medical therapy
- Able to provide informed consent

EXCLUSION CRITERIA
- Acute coronary syndrome within 3 months
- Heart failure NYHA Class III-IV
- Renal dysfunction (eGFR < 30)
- Active malignancy

METHODOLOGY
Baseline metabolomic profiling using targeted LC-MS/MS panel measuring:
- Lipid species (ceramides, phospholipids)
- Amino acid metabolites
- Energy metabolism intermediates
- Oxidative stress markers

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Primary analysis by intention-to-treat principle using Cox proportional hazards model. Secondary analyses include per-protocol analysis and metabolomic biomarker correlation studies.

EXPECTED OUTCOMES
This trial aims to demonstrate clinical utility of metabolomics in precision cardiovascular medicine, potentially improving patient outcomes through personalized therapy selection.
