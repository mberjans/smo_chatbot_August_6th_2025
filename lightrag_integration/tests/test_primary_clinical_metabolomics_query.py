Primary Success Test for Clinical Metabolomics Oracle MVP System.

This module implements the critical primary success test for CMO-LIGHTRAG-008-T03:
"Write primary success test: 'What is clinical metabolomics?' query"

This test validates the core MVP success criterion that the system can successfully
answer the fundamental question "What is clinical metabolomics?" using only 
information from ingested PDFs, with proper validation of response quality,
factual accuracy, and performance metrics.

Primary Success Criteria:
- System must accurately answer "What is clinical metabolomics?" using only PDF content
- Response relevance score > 80% (manual evaluation framework)
- Factual accuracy verified against source papers
- No hallucinated information not present in source documents
- Response time < 30 seconds
- Response length > 100 characters (substantial response)
- Response contains "metabolomics" and clinical/biomedical terms
- Proper error handling and graceful failure modes

Test Structure:
- TestPrimaryClinicalMetabolomicsQuery: Core success test implementation
- TestResponseQualityValidation: Response quality assessment framework
- TestPerformanceMetrics: Performance benchmarking and monitoring
- TestFactualAccuracy: Validation against source documents
- TestErrorHandling: Graceful failure scenarios

    Clinical metabolomics is the application of metabolomics technologies and methods 
    to clinical medicine and healthcare. It involves the comprehensive analysis of 
    small molecules (metabolites) in biological samples such as blood, urine, tissue, 
    and other bodily fluids to understand disease processes, diagnose conditions, 
    monitor treatment responses, and develop personalized medicine approaches.
    
    Key aspects of clinical metabolomics include:
    
    1. Biomarker Discovery: Identification of metabolite signatures that can serve 
    as biomarkers for disease diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic monitoring.
    
    2. Disease Mechanisms: Understanding how metabolic pathways are altered in 
    disease states, providing insights into pathophysiology and potential 
    therapeutic targets.
    
    3. Personalized Medicine: Using individual metabolic profiles to tailor 
    treatment strategies and predict treatment responses.
    
    4. Drug Development: Supporting pharmaceutical research through mechanism 
    elucidation, safety assessment, and efficacy evaluation.
    
    5. Analytical Technologies: Utilizing advanced analytical platforms such as 
    mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS, GC-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) 
    spectroscopy for comprehensive metabolite profiling.
    
    Clinical metabolomics has applications across numerous medical specialties 
    including cardiology, oncology, endocrinology, nephrology, and neurology. 
    It represents a bridge between basic metabolomics research and clinical 
    practice, with the goal of improving patient outcomes through better 
    understanding of human metabolism in health and disease.
    """
    
    BIOMARKER_DISCOVERY_CONTENT = """
    Biomarker discovery represents one of the most important applications of 
    clinical metabolomics. Metabolite biomarkers can provide valuable information 
    about disease states that may not be apparent through traditional clinical 
    markers. Examples include:
    
    - Diabetes: Elevated glucose, altered branched-chain amino acids, and 
      modified lipid profiles
    - Cardiovascular disease: Changes in cholesterol metabolites, TMAO levels, 
      and inflammatory markers
    - Cancer: Altered energy metabolism, modified amino acid profiles, and 
      tumor-specific metabolic signatures
    - Kidney disease: Accumulation of uremic toxins, altered creatinine 
      metabolism, and electrolyte imbalances
      
    The biomarker discovery process typically involves sample collection, 
    metabolite extraction, analytical measurement, statistical analysis, 
    and validation in independent cohorts.
    """
    
    ANALYTICAL_PLATFORMS_CONTENT = """
    Clinical metabolomics relies on sophisticated analytical platforms for 
    accurate and reproducible metabolite measurements:
    
    1. Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS): Provides high 
    sensitivity and specificity for a wide range of metabolites, particularly 
    polar and semi-polar compounds.
    
    2. Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS): Excellent for volatile 
    and semi-volatile metabolites, often requiring chemical derivatization.
    
    3. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy: Non-destructive analysis 
    providing quantitative metabolite information, though with lower sensitivity 
    than mass spectrometry.
    
    4. Capillary Electrophoresis-Mass Spectrometry (CE-MS): Particularly useful 
    for charged metabolites and providing orthogonal separation to LC-MS.
    
    Each platform has unique strengths and limitations, and many clinical 
    metabolomics studies employ multiple complementary technologies for 
    comprehensive metabolite coverage.
