# Comprehensive PDF-to-Query Workflow Integration Test Scenarios

## Overview

This document specifies comprehensive test scenarios for end-to-end PDF to query workflow integration testing, building upon the existing excellent test infrastructure in `conftest.py`, `test_pdf_lightrag_integration.py`, and related test files.

## Design Philosophy

The test scenarios are designed to:
1. **Leverage Existing Infrastructure**: Build upon the sophisticated fixtures and mock systems already implemented
2. **Extend Current Patterns**: Follow established testing patterns while adding new comprehensive scenarios
3. **Real-World Validation**: Use the actual `Clinical_Metabolomics_paper.pdf` alongside mock data
4. **Production Readiness**: Test scenarios that reflect real clinical research workflows

## Test Infrastructure Analysis

### Existing Strengths to Leverage
- **Comprehensive Fixtures**: `conftest.py` provides excellent async testing, mock systems, and biomedical content generators
- **Realistic Mock Data**: `BiomedicalPDFGenerator` creates authentic clinical research content
- **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in cost tracking, progress monitoring, and performance assessment
- **Error Injection**: `ErrorInjector` class for controlled failure testing
- **Integration Environment**: Complete `integration_test_environment` fixture with cleanup

### Key Components to Extend
- `MockLightRAGSystem`: Advanced mock with realistic entity/relationship extraction
- `BiomedicalPDFGenerator`: Disease-specific content with metabolomics focus  
- `ResponseQualityAssessor`: Quality metrics and validation framework
- Test markers: `@pytest.mark.biomedical`, `@pytest.mark.integration`, `@pytest.mark.performance`
