- **Fixture Compatibility**: Works with existing `integration_test_environment`
- **Import Integration**: Automatic fixture availability through `conftest.py`
- **Async Support**: Full async/await compatibility for comprehensive testing

## Technical Features

### PDF Creation Capabilities

```python
# Automatic fallback to text files if PyMuPDF not available
if PDF_CREATION_AVAILABLE:
    self._create_pdf_with_pymupdf(study_dict, pdf_path)
else:
    self._create_text_fallback(study_dict, pdf_path)
```

### Smart Study Object Handling

```python
# Handles both dictionary and ClinicalStudyData objects
if hasattr(study, '__dict__'):  # ClinicalStudyData object
    filename = f"{study.study_id.lower()}_{study.disease_condition}.pdf"
    study_dict = {
        'filename': filename,
        'content': study.summary,
        'metadata': {...}
    }
else:  # Dictionary object
    study_dict = study
```

### Cross-Document Synthesis Assessment

```python
# Multi-dimensional synthesis quality assessment
overall_score = (
    statistics.mean(pattern_scores.values()) * 0.4 +
    source_integration_score * 0.3 +
    consistency_score * 0.3
) * 100
```

## Testing Validation

All enhanced fixtures have been validated through comprehensive demonstration tests:

- ✅ **PDF Creation**: Creates actual PDF/text files with realistic biomedical content
- ✅ **Collection Management**: Handles multi-disease study collections efficiently
- ✅ **Performance Testing**: Supports large-scale batch processing scenarios
- ✅ **Disease-Specific Testing**: Focused diabetes research scenario support
- ✅ **Integration Environment**: Complete end-to-end testing capabilities
- ✅ **Cross-Document Synthesis**: Advanced synthesis validation and quality assessment

## Usage Examples

### Basic PDF Creation
```python
@pytest.mark.biomedical
async def test_pdf_creation(pdf_creator, multi_disease_study_collection):
    pdf_paths = pdf_creator.create_batch_pdfs(multi_disease_study_collection[:3])
    assert len(pdf_paths) == 3
    for pdf_path in pdf_paths:
        assert pdf_path.exists()
```

### Integration Testing
```python
@pytest.mark.integration
async def test_comprehensive_workflow(enhanced_integration_environment):
    # Setup test scenario with actual PDFs
    stats = await enhanced_integration_environment.setup_comprehensive_test_scenario("test")
    
    # Run cross-document synthesis test
    result = await enhanced_integration_environment.run_cross_document_synthesis_test(
        "What are the key biomarkers across diseases?"
    )
    
    # Validate synthesis quality
    assert result['synthesis_assessment']['overall_synthesis_quality'] > 70
```

### Performance Testing
```python
@pytest.mark.performance
async def test_large_scale_processing(large_scale_pdf_collection):
    # Create PDF batches for performance testing
    all_batches = large_scale_pdf_collection.create_all_batches()
    metrics = large_scale_pdf_collection.get_performance_metrics()
    
    assert metrics['creation_efficiency'] > 80
```

## Integration with Existing Infrastructure
