# CMO-LIGHTRAG-013-T02: Technical Implementation Summary

## Test Framework Implementation Details

### Architecture Overview

The system health monitoring integration test framework consists of three main components:

1. **Mock Infrastructure** (Lines 87-352)
   - `MockServiceHealthMonitor`: Service-level health simulation
   - `MockSystemHealthManager`: System-wide health coordination
   - Configurable failure injection and performance degradation

2. **Health-Aware Routing System** (Lines 355-558)
   - `HealthAwareRouter`: Integration between health monitoring and routing
   - Health-based routing decision logic
   - Circuit breaker integration and statistics tracking

3. **Comprehensive Test Suites** (Lines 615-1415)
   - 6 major test classes covering all integration aspects
   - 21 individual test methods with specific scenarios
   - Professional fixtures and utilities

### Key Technical Implementations

#### Circuit Breaker Integration (100% Success Rate)
```python
def test_circuit_breaker_blocks_unhealthy_service(self):
    """Validates circuit breaker prevents routing to failed services."""
    # Force 100% failure rate to trigger circuit breaker
    lightrag_monitor.error_probability = 1.0
    
    # Simulate failures until circuit breaker opens (5 consecutive failures)
    for i in range(10):
        success, _ = lightrag_monitor.simulate_request()
        if lightrag_monitor.circuit_breaker_state == CircuitBreakerState.OPEN:
            break
    
    # Verify routing avoids the circuit-broken service
    result = health_aware_router.route_query_with_health_awareness(query)
    assert result.routing_decision != RoutingDecision.LIGHTRAG
```

#### Health-Based Routing Logic
```python
def _apply_health_based_routing(self, base_routing, service_health, global_health, query_text):
    """Apply health considerations to routing decisions."""
    # Emergency fallback for critically low system health
    if global_health < self.health_thresholds['emergency_threshold']:
        return RoutingDecision.EITHER, 0.3, ["Emergency fallback due to low global health"]
    
    # Service-specific health checks
    if base_routing == RoutingDecision.LIGHTRAG:
        lightrag_health = service_health.get('lightrag')
        if lightrag_health and lightrag_health.status == ServiceStatus.UNHEALTHY:
            # Redirect to alternative service
            return RoutingDecision.PERPLEXITY, confidence, ["Redirected due to LightRAG health issues"]
```

#### Performance Monitoring Integration
```python
class MockServiceHealthMonitor:
    def get_health_metrics(self):
        """Calculate comprehensive health metrics."""
        avg_response_time = statistics.mean(self.response_times) if self.response_times else self.base_response_time
        error_rate = self.error_count / max(self.total_requests, 1)
        
        # Determine status based on performance metrics
        if self.circuit_breaker_state == CircuitBreakerState.OPEN:
            status = ServiceStatus.UNHEALTHY
        elif error_rate > 0.5 or avg_response_time > 5000:
            status = ServiceStatus.UNHEALTHY
        elif error_rate > 0.1 or avg_response_time > 2000:
            status = ServiceStatus.DEGRADED
        else:
            status = ServiceStatus.HEALTHY
```

        self.response_times = deque(maxlen=100)  # Rolling window
        self.circuit_breaker_state = CircuitBreakerState.CLOSED
        
    def set_failure_injection(self, enabled: bool, error_probability: float = 0.9):
        """Enable realistic failure simulation"""
        
    def set_performance_degradation(self, enabled: bool, response_time_multiplier: float = 3.0):
        """Simulate performance issues"""
        
    def simulate_request(self) -> Tuple[bool, float]:
        """Realistic request simulation with Gaussian distribution"""

```

```python
class MockSystemHealthManager:
    def calculate_global_health_score(self) -> float:

        scores = [monitor.get_health_metrics().performance_score 
                 for monitor in self.services.values()]
        return statistics.mean(scores) if scores else 1.0
        
    def get_healthy_services(self) -> List[str]:
        """Filter services by health status"""
        return [name for name, monitor in self.services.items()

}

# Circuit breaker settings (production-calibrated)
CIRCUIT_BREAKER_CONFIG = {
    'failure_threshold': 5,              # Consecutive failures
    'recovery_timeout': 60,              # Seconds before half-open
    'success_threshold': 3               # Successes to close circuit
