Production-Ready Test Suite for Routing Decision Logic

This test suite validates the routing decision logic for the BiomedicalQueryRouter
across all core routing categories, confidence thresholds, uncertainty handling,
performance requirements, and integration scenarios.

Performance Targets:
- Total routing time: < 50ms
- Classification response: < 2 seconds  
- Routing accuracy: >90%

Test Coverage:
1. Core Routing Accuracy - Test each routing decision type
2. Confidence Threshold Validation - Test behavior at each confidence level
3. Performance Tests - Validate timing requirements
4. Uncertainty Handling - Test fallback strategies
5. Edge Cases - Empty queries, malformed input, etc.
6. Integration Tests - Test with actual router components
