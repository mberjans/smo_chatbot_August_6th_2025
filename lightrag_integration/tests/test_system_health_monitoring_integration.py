System Health Monitoring Integration Tests for Routing Logic

This comprehensive test suite validates the integration between system health monitoring
and routing decisions, ensuring that the routing system properly responds to service
health changes and maintains system resilience.

Test Coverage:
1. Circuit breaker patterns for external API calls
2. System health checks that influence routing decisions  
3. Failure detection and recovery mechanisms
4. Performance monitoring that affects routing
5. Load balancing between multiple backends
6. Service availability impact on routing

Integration Points:
- Health status affecting routing decisions (healthy service preferred)
- Circuit breaker states preventing certain routing paths
- Performance degradation triggering fallback mechanisms
- Service failures causing routing re-evaluation
