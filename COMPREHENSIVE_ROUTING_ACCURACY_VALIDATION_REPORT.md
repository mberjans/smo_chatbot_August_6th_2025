## SPECIFIC TECHNICAL RECOMMENDATIONS

### 1. Routing Logic Improvements

```python
# Current issue: HYBRID queries routing to single systems
# Recommended fix: Enhanced dual-requirement detection

def detect_hybrid_requirements(query):
    knowledge_indicators = ["pathways", "mechanism", "molecular"]
    temporal_indicators = ["recent", "latest", "current", "2024", "2025"]
    
    has_knowledge = any(indicator in query.lower() for indicator in knowledge_indicators)
    has_temporal = any(indicator in query.lower() for indicator in temporal_indicators)
    
    if has_knowledge and has_temporal:
        return RoutingDecision.HYBRID, high_confidence
```

### 2. Confidence Score Calibration

```python
# Recommended confidence thresholds by category:
CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLDS = {
    RoutingDecision.LIGHTRAG: {
        'high': 0.8,      # Clear pathway/mechanism queries
        'medium': 0.6,    # General biomedical queries  
        'low': 0.4        # Ambiguous queries
    },
    RoutingDecision.PERPLEXITY: {
        'high': 0.9,      # Strong temporal indicators
        'medium': 0.7,    # Recent research queries
        'low': 0.5        # General current info
    },
    RoutingDecision.HYBRID: {
        'high': 0.8,      # Clear dual requirements
        'medium': 0.6,    # Moderate dual indicators
        'low': 0.4        # Weak dual signals
    }
}
```

### 3. Load Balancing Fix

```python
# Current issue: 80/20 split instead of balanced
# Recommended: Implement true weighted round-robin

def select_backend_improved(self, routing_decision):
    if routing_decision == RoutingDecision.EITHER:
        # Use health-aware weighted selection
        return self.weighted_round_robin_with_health()
    return self.direct_routing(routing_decision)
```

## CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The routing decision engine requires **significant improvements** before meeting the >90% accuracy requirement for production deployment. While the system architecture and performance are solid, core routing logic has critical deficiencies, particularly in HYBRID query detection and confidence calibration.

2. **Prioritize HYBRID detection fixes** (60% failure rate is unacceptable)
3. **Implement confidence recalibration** across all categories
4. **Fix load balancing algorithm** for proper distribution

**Timeline Estimate:**
- **Critical fixes:** 1-2 weeks  
- **Full accuracy target:** 3-4 weeks
- **Production readiness:** 4-6 weeks with comprehensive re-testing

**Risk Assessment:**
- **HIGH RISK** if deployed with current accuracy levels
- **User experience impact** from incorrect routing decisions
- **System reliability** compromised by poor confidence scores

The system shows excellent architectural foundation and performance characteristics. With focused improvements on routing logic and confidence calibration, it can achieve the required >90% accuracy for successful production deployment.
