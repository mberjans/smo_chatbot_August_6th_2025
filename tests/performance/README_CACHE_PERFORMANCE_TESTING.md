## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Memory Errors**: Reduce test scale or increase system memory
2. **Timeout Failures**: Increase timeout values in pytest configuration
3. **Import Errors**: Ensure all dependencies are installed via requirements.txt

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Enable verbose logging and debug output
PYTHONPATH=. python -v tests/performance/run_comprehensive_cache_performance_validation.py --scale small
```

### Performance Optimization Tips
1. **Cache Size Tuning**: Adjust L1/L2 cache sizes based on available memory
2. **TTL Optimization**: Fine-tune TTL values for different query types
3. **Concurrency Limits**: Balance concurrent users with system resources
4. **Cleanup Intervals**: Optimize cache cleanup frequency for performance
